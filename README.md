#### DEVELOPER'S NOTE
> This is an example of a centralized application created in initial days of my "web dev" journey. Now, I'm in favour of something decentralized, > something which will not be such extensively vulnerable to curreuption, hijacking, and central failure. If anybody's interested, we can hop on > something similar.
